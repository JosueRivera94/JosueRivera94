## Hi, I'm Josue Rivera! ðŸ‘‹

I have worked in the area of servers and systems management for 2 years. <br>
I am on the way to grow as a web developer to create solutions according to the needs of an institution.<br>
I want to be a professional web developer with the ability to take on jobs or consultancies remotely and provide custom solutions.<br>
I am a responsible, self-taught person who always seeks to have a balance in everything and have harmony to achieve a good result.
